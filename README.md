### Monserrat's Abstraction

### Yanella's Abstraction

### Algorithms
* Using a random number generator to create numbers assigned to certain colors

* the functions were difficult to figure out, used the internet for guidance
* labeling the divs right and using the correct selector for JQuery
* trying to figure out why I could not see the algorithm working, ended up being syntax ( missing(), id instead of class)
